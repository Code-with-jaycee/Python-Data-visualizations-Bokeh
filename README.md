We will try to learn main things about Bokeh python library

# What is Bokeh?

Bokeh is a Python toolkit for creating highly interactive graphs as well as visualizations. This is accomplished in bokeh with HTML and JavaScript. This makes it an effective tool for developing projects, bespoke charts, and web design applications.


# Scatter Charts
Each unique datapoint in the data is plotted separately in a scatter plot. Each datapoint on the x-axis does indeed have a corresponding, independently plotted value on the y-axis when two variables are plotted against one another. The plot appears to be a jumble of disconnected points as a result.
