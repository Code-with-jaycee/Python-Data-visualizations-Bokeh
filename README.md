We will try to learn main things about Bokeh python library

# What is Bokeh?

Bokeh is a Python toolkit for creating highly interactive graphs as well as visualizations. This is accomplished in bokeh with HTML and JavaScript. This makes it an effective tool for developing projects, bespoke charts, and web design applications.


# Scatter Charts
Each unique datapoint in the data is plotted separately in a scatter plot. Each datapoint on the x-axis does indeed have a corresponding, independently plotted value on the y-axis when two variables are plotted against one another. The plot appears to be a jumble of disconnected points as a result.

# Line Charts

A line chart is a representation that shows data as a collection of dots connected by lines. It is used to identify patterns in our data and monitor how it changes over time.

# Pie Charts

A pie chart is a circular graph that shows how much of the data falls into each category by dividing it into slices. It is a quick and simple approach to see which categories in our data make up what proportion of the entire dataset. Pie charts with a hole in the middle are what donut charts are.

# Histogram

Histograms are used to plot numerical data according to the range they fall into. The data is plotted in the form of bins, or rectangles and the y-axis corresponds to the amount of data present in a certain range or at a certain point.
