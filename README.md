We will try to learn main things about Bokeh python library

# What is Bokeh?

Bokeh is a Python toolkit for creating highly interactive graphs as well as visualizations. This is accomplished in bokeh with HTML and JavaScript. This makes it an effective tool for developing projects, bespoke charts, and web design applications.


# Scatter Charts
Each unique datapoint in the data is plotted separately in a scatter plot. Each datapoint on the x-axis does indeed have a corresponding, independently plotted value on the y-axis when two variables are plotted against one another. The plot appears to be a jumble of disconnected points as a result.

# Line Charts

A line chart is a representation that shows data as a collection of dots connected by lines. It is used to identify patterns in our data and monitor how it changes over time.

# Pie Charts

A pie chart is a circular graph that shows how much of the data falls into each category by dividing it into slices. It is a quick and simple approach to see which categories in our data make up what proportion of the entire dataset. Pie charts with a hole in the middle are what donut charts are.

# Histogram

Plotting numerical data according to the range it falls into is done using histograms. The y-axis indicates how much data is present in a given range or at a given moment, and the data is represented as rectangles or bins.
# Bar Plot

Bar charts are used to illustrate the data distribution for categorical data, while histograms are applied to plot numerical data distributions. Additionally, bins are used to plot the volume of data. A stacked bar chart is one in which the bins are layered one on top of the other.
# Area Plot
When the region below a line is shaded, an area chart combines the lines and bars. We may visualize the evolution of several groups' values over time using an area chart. To display the vertical range of data, the area chart uses many baselines.

# Layout Function

Our numerous plots and widges are arranged using Bokeh's layout feature. We can view multiple graphs simultaneously as a result of this. It enables you to create plot grids, which are primarily utilized when constructing dashboards.
